                    <h4>difference between flexbox and grid?</h4>
                    <p> <small>Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS Grid Layout and CSS Flexbox Layout is
                            that
                            flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension - either a row or a column. Grid was
                            designed
                            for two-dimensional layout - rows, and columns at the same time.</small> </p>

                    <h4>difference between bootstrap and tailwind?</h4>
                    <p> <small>Bootstrap comes with a set of pre-styled responsive, mobile-first components that possess
                            a
                            definite UI kit. Tailwind CSS uses a set of utility classes to create a neat UI with more
                            flexibility and uniqueness. Sites created using Bootstrap follow the generic pattern that
                            makes
                            them look identical.</small> </p>

                    <h4>what is css box model?
                    </h4>
                    <p> <small>In web development, the CSS box model refers to how HTML elements are modeled in browser
                            engines and how the dimensions of those HTML elements are derived from CSS properties. It is
                            a
                            fundamental concept for the composition of HTML webpages.</small> </p>

                    <h4>what is a semantic tag?</h4>
                    <p> <small>Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather
                            than
                            just presentation. For example, a

                            tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and
                            presentational
                            because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.</small> </p>
